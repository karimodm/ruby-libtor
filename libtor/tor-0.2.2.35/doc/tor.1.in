.SH "NAME"
tor \- The second\-generation onion router
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBtor\fR [\fIOPTION\fR \fIvalue\fR]\&...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fItor\fR is a connection\-oriented anonymizing communication service\&. Users choose a source\-routed path through a set of nodes, and negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each node knows its predecessor and successor, but no others\&. Traffic flowing down the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node, which reveals the downstream node\&.
.sp
Basically \fItor\fR provides a distributed network of servers ("onion routers")\&. Users bounce their TCP streams \(em web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc \(em around the routers, and recipients, observers, and even the routers themselves have difficulty tracking the source of the stream\&.

Do not start Tor with a console log unless explicitly requested to do so\&. (By default, Tor starts out logging messages at level "notice" or higher to the console, until it has parsed its configuration\&.)
.RE
.sp
Other options can be specified either on the command\-line (\-\-option value), or in the configuration file (option value or option "value")\&. Options are case\-insensitive\&. C\-style escaped characters are allowed inside quoted values\&. Options on the command line take precedence over options found in the configuration file, except indicated otherwise\&. To split one configuration entry into multiple lines, use a single \e before the end of the line\&. Comments can be used in such multiline entries, but they must start at the beginning of a line\&.

\fBBandwidthRate\fR \fIN\fR \fBbytes\fR|\fBKB\fR|\fBMB\fR|\fBGB\fR
.RS 4
A token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth usage on this node to the specified number of bytes per second, and the average outgoing bandwidth usage to that same value\&. If you want to run a relay in the public network, this needs to be
\fIat the very least\fR
20 KB (that is, 20480 bytes)\&. (Default: 5 MB)
.RE
.PP
\fBBandwidthBurst\fR \fIN\fR \fBbytes\fR|\fBKB\fR|\fBMB\fR|\fBGB\fR

.RE
.PP
\fBMaxAdvertisedBandwidth\fR \fIN\fR \fBbytes\fR|\fBKB\fR|\fBMB\fR|\fBGB\fR
.RS 4
If set, we will not advertise more than this amount of bandwidth for our BandwidthRate\&. Server operators who want to reduce the number of clients who ask to build circuits through them (since this is proportional to advertised bandwidth rate) can thus reduce the CPU demands on their server without impacting network performance\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBRelayBandwidthRate\fR \fIN\fR \fBbytes\fR|\fBKB\fR|\fBMB\fR|\fBGB\fR
.RS 4
If not 0, a separate token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth usage for _relayed traffic_ on this node to the specified number of bytes per second, and the average outgoing bandwidth usage to that same value\&. Relayed traffic currently is calculated to include answers to directory requests, but that may change in future versions\&. (Default: 0)
.RE
.PP
\fBRelayBandwidthBurst\fR \fIN\fR \fBbytes\fR|\fBKB\fR|\fBMB\fR|\fBGB\fR

.PP
\fBPerConnBWRate\fR \fIN\fR \fBbytes\fR|\fBKB\fR|\fBMB\fR|\fBGB\fR
.RS 4
If set, do separate rate limiting for each connection from a non\-relay\&. You should never need to change this value, since a network\-wide value is published in the consensus and your relay will use that value\&. (Default: 0)
.RE
.PP
\fBPerConnBWBurst\fR \fIN\fR \fBbytes\fR|\fBKB\fR|\fBMB\fR|\fBGB\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fBConnLimit\fR \fINUM\fR
.RS 4
The minimum number of file descriptors that must be available to the Tor process before it will start\&. Tor will ask the OS for as many file descriptors as the OS will allow (you can find this by "ulimit \-H \-n")\&. If this number is less than ConnLimit, then Tor will refuse to start\&.


You probably don\(cqt need to adjust this\&. It has no effect on Windows since that platform lacks getrlimit()\&. (Default: 1000)
.RE
.PP
\fBConstrainedSockets\fR \fB0\fR|\fB1\fR
.RS 4
If set, Tor will tell the kernel to attempt to shrink the buffers for all sockets to the size specified in
\fBConstrainedSockSize\fR\&. This is useful for virtual servers and other environments where system level TCP buffers may be limited\&. If you\(cqre on a virtual server, and you encounter the "Error creating network socket: No buffer space available" message, you are likely experiencing this problem\&.


The preferred solution is to have the admin increase the buffer pool for the host itself via /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem or equivalent facility; this configuration option is a second\-resort\&.


The DirPort option should also not be used if TCP buffers are scarce\&. The cached directory requests consume additional sockets which exacerbates the problem\&.


You should
\fBnot\fR
enable this feature unless you encounter the "no buffer space available" issue\&. Reducing the TCP buffers affects window size for the TCP stream and will reduce throughput in proportion to round trip time on long paths\&. (Default: 0\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fBConstrainedSockSize\fR \fIN\fR \fBbytes\fR|\fBKB\fR
.RS 4
When
\fBConstrainedSockets\fR
is enabled the receive and transmit buffers for all sockets will be set to this limit\&. Must be a value between 2048 and 262144, in 1024 byte increments\&. Default of 8192 is recommended\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBControlPort\fR \fIPORT\fR|\fBauto\fR
.RS 4
If set, Tor will accept connections on this port and allow those connections to control the Tor process using the Tor Control Protocol (described in control\-spec\&.txt)\&. Note: unless you also specify one or more of
\fBHashedControlPassword\fR
or
\fBCookieAuthentication\fR, setting this option will cause Tor to allow any process on the local host to control it\&. (Setting both authentication methods means either method is sufficient to authenticate to Tor\&.) This option is required for many Tor controllers; most use the value of 9051\&. Set it to "auto" to have Tor pick a port for you\&. (Default: 0)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBControlListenAddress\fR \fIIP\fR[:\fIPORT\fR]
.RS 4
Bind the controller listener to this address\&. If you specify a port, bind to this port rather than the one specified in ControlPort\&. We strongly recommend that you leave this alone unless you know what you\(cqre doing, since giving attackers access to your control listener is really dangerous\&. (Default: 127\&.0\&.0\&.1) This directive can be specified multiple times to bind to multiple addresses/ports\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBControlSocket\fR \fIPath\fR
.RS 4
Like ControlPort, but listens on a Unix domain socket, rather than a TCP socket\&. (Unix and Unix\-like systems only\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fBControlSocketsGroupWritable\fR \fB0\fR|\fB1\fR
.RS 4
If this option is set to 0, don\(cqt allow the filesystem group to read and write unix sockets (e\&.g\&. ControlSocket)\&. If the option is set to 1, make the control socket readable and writable by the default GID\&. (Default: 0)
.RE
.PP
\fBHashedControlPassword\fR \fIhashed_password\fR
.RS 4
Allow connections on the control port if they present the password whose one\-way hash is
\fIhashed_password\fR\&. You can compute the hash of a password by running "tor \-\-hash\-password
\fIpassword\fR"\&. You can provide several acceptable passwords by using more than one HashedControlPassword line\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCookieAuthentication\fR \fB0\fR|\fB1\fR
.RS 4
If this option is set to 1, allow connections on the control port when the connecting process knows the contents of a file named "control_auth_cookie", which Tor will create in its data directory\&. This authentication method should only be used on systems with good filesystem security\&. (Default: 0)
.RE
.PP
\fBCookieAuthFile\fR \fIPath\fR
.RS 4
If set, this option overrides the default location and file name for Tor\(cqs cookie file\&. (See CookieAuthentication above\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fBCookieAuthFileGroupReadable\fR \fB0\fR|\fB1\fR|\fIGroupname\fR
.RS 4
If this option is set to 0, don\(cqt allow the filesystem group to read the cookie file\&. If the option is set to 1, make the cookie file readable by the default GID\&. [Making the file readable by other groups is not yet implemented; let us know if you need this for some reason\&.] (Default: 0)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBControlPortWriteToFile\fR \fIPath\fR
.RS 4
If set, Tor writes the address and port of any control port it opens to this address\&. Usable by controllers to learn the actual control port when ControlPort is set to "auto"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBControlPortFileGroupReadable\fR \fB0\fR|\fB1\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fBDirServer\fR [\fInickname\fR] [\fBflags\fR] \fIaddress\fR:\fIport\fR \fIfingerprint\fR
.RS 4
Use a nonstandard authoritative directory server at the provided address and port, with the specified key fingerprint\&. This option can be repeated many times, for multiple authoritative directory servers\&. Flags are separated by spaces, and determine what kind of an authority this directory is\&. By default, every authority is authoritative for current ("v2")\-style directories, unless the "no\-v2" flag is given\&. If the "v1" flags is provided, Tor will use this server as an authority for old\-style (v1) directories as well\&. (Only directory mirrors care about this\&.) Tor will use this server as an authority for hidden service information if the "hs" flag is set, or if the "v1" flag is set and the "no\-hs" flag is
\fBnot\fR
set\&. Tor will use this authority as a bridge authoritative directory if the "bridge" flag is set\&. If a flag "orport=\fBport\fR" is given, Tor will use the given port when opening encrypted tunnels to the dirserver\&. Lastly, if a flag "v3ident=\fBfp\fR" is given, the dirserver is a v3 directory authority whose v3 long\-term signing key has the fingerprint
\fBfp\fR\&.


If no
\fBdirserver\fR
line is given, Tor will use the default directory servers\&. NOTE: this option is intended for setting up a private Tor network with its own directory authorities\&. If you use it, you will be distinguishable from other users, because you won\(cqt believe the same authorities they do\&.

As DirServer, but replaces less of the default directory authorities\&. Using AlternateDirAuthority replaces the default Tor directory authorities, but leaves the hidden service authorities and bridge authorities in place\&. Similarly, Using AlternateHSAuthority replaces the default hidden service authorities, but not the directory or bridge authorities\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDisableAllSwap\fR \fB0\fR|\fB1\fR
.RS 4
If set to 1, Tor will attempt to lock all current and future memory pages, so that memory cannot be paged out\&. Windows, OS X and Solaris are currently not supported\&. We believe that this feature works on modern Gnu/Linux distributions, and that it should work on *BSD systems (untested)\&. This option requires that you start your Tor as root, and you should use the
\fBUser\fR
option to properly reduce Tor\(cqs privileges\&. (Default: 0)
.RE
.PP
\fBFetchDirInfoEarly\fR \fB0\fR|\fB1\fR

.RE
.PP
\fBFetchHidServDescriptors\fR \fB0\fR|\fB1\fR

to the standard output stream, the standard error stream, or to the system log\&. (The "syslog" value is only supported on Unix\&.) Recognized severity levels are debug, info, notice, warn, and err\&. We advise using "notice" in most cases, since anything more verbose may provide sensitive information to an attacker who obtains the logs\&. If only one severity level is given, all messages of that level or higher will be sent to the listed destination\&.

You can specify any number of severity ranges for a single log statement, each of them prefixed by a comma\-separated list of logging domains\&. You can prefix a domain with ~ to indicate negation, and use * to indicate "all domains"\&. If you specify a severity range without a list of domains, it matches all domains\&.


This is an advanced feature which is most useful for debugging one or two of Tor\(cqs subsystems at a time\&.


The currently recognized domains are: general, crypto, net, config, fs, protocol, mm, http, app, control, circ, rend, bug, dir, dirserv, or, edge, acct, hist, and handshake\&. Domain names are case\-insensitive\&.


For example, "Log [handshake]debug [~net,~mm]info notice stdout" sends to stdout: all handshake messages of any severity, all info\-and\-higher messages from domains other than networking and memory management, and all messages of severity notice or higher\&.

Never send more than the specified number of bytes in a given accounting period, or receive more than that number in the period\&.

When the number of bytes gets low, Tor will stop accepting new connections and circuits\&. When the number of bytes is exhausted, Tor will hibernate until some time in the next accounting period\&. To prevent all servers from waking at the same time, Tor will also wait until a random point in each period before waking up\&.

\fBfingerprint\fR
file in the
\fIDataDirectory\fR

\fB!reject\fR
then descriptors from the given identity (fingerprint) are rejected by this server\&. If it is
\fB!invalid\fR
then descriptors are accepted but marked in the directory as not valid, that is, not recommended\&.
